Computer Science Algorithms For PHP7
========================

Welcome to Computer Science Algorithms For PHP7 Here you'll find implementations of 
popular algorithms and data structures in everyone's favorite new version PHP7, with 
detailed explanations of how they work.


Who is this for?
--------------

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- 
or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the 
theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!

The goal of this project is to **explain how algorithms work**. 
The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, 
not on making a reusable library that you can drop into your own projects. 
That said, most of the code should be ready for production use 
but you may need to tweak it to fit into your own codebase.
